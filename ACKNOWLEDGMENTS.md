## Derived Work

### urql & Wonka

Mearie's stream-based exchange system and core implementation are derived from [urql](https://github.com/urql-graphql/urql) and its underlying stream library [Wonka](https://github.com/0no-co/wonka).

The exchange architecture, stream utilities, and client implementation in Mearie are substantially based on urql's patterns and Wonka's stream primitives. The core concepts, patterns, and much of the implementation approach closely follow the original work by the urql team.
